# Sorting Visualizer
Created a Sorting Visualizer using HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Implemented Multiple Sorting Algorithms: The visualizer supports a wide range of sorting algorithms, including:

Bubble Sort
Insertion Sort
Selection Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Heap Sort

Time(Best,Avg and Worst) and Space Complexity of each Sorting Alogorithm is also implemented

Benefits of Using the Sorting Visualizer:

Educational Tool: The visualizer is an excellent tool for learning and understanding sorting algorithms.

Problem-Solving Skill Development: By observing the sorting process, users can develop problem-solving skills and learn to analyze algorithms.

Algorithm Comparison: The visualizer allows for easy comparison of different sorting algorithms, helping users choose the most appropriate algorithm for their specific use cases.
